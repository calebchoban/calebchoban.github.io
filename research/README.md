Here you can find general overviews of dust, different aspects of my research, and informative diagrams.

# The What, Why, and How of Dust
* [What is dust?]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Is it similar to dust bunnies?
* [Why is it important?]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Hint, both theorists and observers should care.
* [How do we observe dust?]{:.heading.flip-title} --- The range of wavelengths might surprise you.
