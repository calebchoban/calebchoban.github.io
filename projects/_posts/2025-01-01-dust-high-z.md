# Dust Build-Up at High-z


ALMA has observed extremely dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $$z>5$$ in the rest-frame infrared and JWST has found a population of extremely reddend galaxies in the optical (i.e. highly dust attenuated) previously undetected by Hubble. 
These DSFGs at such high redshifts are a surprising find, opening up many questions: 

* **How can galaxies form so much dust when the Universe is $$\lesssim 1$$ Gyr old?**
* **Can these observations constrain uncertainties in the dust life cycle?**
* **Are observations of DSFGs biased to an extreme subsample of galaxies?**

Using simulations of galaxies at high redshift incorporating dust evolution models, I attempt to answer these questions and provide insights for future observations with JWST.
